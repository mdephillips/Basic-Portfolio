About me

Hi! My name is Margaret DePhillips. I'm a married mom of two living in Lombard, IL, a west suburb of Chicago. My husband Mike and I celebrated 18 years of marraige on October 26 of this year. We have a 15 year old daughter and a 12 year old son.
Right now I'm a stay at home mom. I'm taking this Bootcamp so that I can develop a new skill set and get a job in IT. My prior career paths have included healthcare, retail and supply chain; I'm ready for my next career challenge.
